            <p>Wildlife trade refers to the products that are derived from non-domesticated animals or plants usually extracted from their natural environment or raised under controlled conditions. It can involve the trade of living or dead individuals, tissues such as skins, bones or meat, or other products. Legal wildlife trade is regulated by the United Nations' Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which currently has 184 member countries called Parties</p><br>

            <h3>TIGERS</h3>
            <p>Tigers (Panthera tigris) are one of the largest predators in the world. Each tiger has their own large territory in which males have a larger home range size than females. According to tiger research (Panthera tigris corbetti) in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, which has been studied by Khao Nang Rum Wildlife Research Station, found that male tigers have a home range size of approximately 267-300 km2 while females home range size is about 60-70 km2. Tigers usually hunt alone at night or at dawn, they are a solitary species except when females feed their cubs.</p>

            <h3>LIONS</h3>
            <p>Lions, with their powerful bodies and excellent senses, are formidable hunters. Lions are the only large cats that live and hunt in groups, or prides, with the females doing most of the hunting.

                Prides vary greatly in size, but can include up to three male lions, around a dozen female lions, and their young, which are raised co-operatively. Typically, the lionesses in the pride will be related to one another, with the female cubs staying with the group with other female lions for life..</p>

            <h3>PANTHER</h3>
            <p>In 1788, Jean-Claude Delamétherie described a black leopard that was kept in the Tower of London and had been brought from Bengal.[1] In 1794, Friedrich Albrecht Anton Meyer proposed the scientific name Felis fusca for this cat, the Indian leopard (P. p. fusca).[2][3] In 1809, Georges Cuvier described a black leopard kept in the Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes that had been brought from Java. Cuvier proposed the name Felis melas, the Javan leopard (P. p. melas).</p>
